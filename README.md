# Notes on Advent of Code 2020

## Day 6

I was able to reuse the chunking code day 4 to make short work of this.

I'm still puzzled at why it's so difficult to factor out functions that work with Iterators in Rust. It seems very easy to get into situations where the return type involves closures that can't be written in the type system, or to get into trouble with the borrow checker.

I looked for a functional way to do "count by" on the characters in a string but wasn't able to find anything.

## Day 5

I was feeling some social pressure to get out the door this morning, so I just did this one with find/replace, `sort`, `bc` and a spreadsheet.

    (echo 'ibase=2'; cat inputs/day5.txt | perl -pe 's/B/1/g; s/F/0/g; s/R/1/g; s/L/0/g;' | sort) | bc | pbcopy

## Day 3 & 4

Rust is feelingâ€¦ kind of annoying! My usual procedure for fixing errors is throwing `.unwrap()`, `&`, `String::from()` and `into_iter()` into the expression until it works.

It would be useful to find a Rust expert who's also doing the Advent of Code.

AxlLind's is particularly clean. I like the itertools approach, though my attempt
to factor out a helper function to separate the file's lines into blank line-delimited
"chunks" failed spectacularly. The return types for Iterators get way too complicated, and
you can't copy them from error messages because they reference closures.

The `lazy_static!` construct seems to break inference in vscode when you use it inside a
function, but not when you use it at module-level. Weird.

## Day 2

First time using regexes in Rust. Overall it seems... mostly reasonable? I got thrown off by a few things:

1. `.captures()[0]` is the full match, and `.captures()[1]` is the first capture.
2. The docs suggested using `lazy_static!` to initialize the RE once rather than in a loop, but this seemed to break type checking in VS Code.
3. ~The [docs][re] don't escape backslashes in regexes, but it seems you need to in your own code.~ Scratch that, they're using raw strings, which look like `r""`.

Also first time using `HashMap`, though in retrospect I only did this because I misinterpreted the question. The "Entry API" seems quite important. The borrow checker makes things like "iterate over all the keys and values in a hash map" surprisingly hard.

Indexing a string is also [pretty annoying][2]. I suppose this is annoyingingess that's hidden in other languages by their being slow, due to Unicode.

## Day 1

I still find Rust's module system incomprehensible.

The issue this time turned out to be that I needed to import my util library as:

    use aoc2020::util;

rather than any of these:

    use crate::util;
    use super::util;
    use super::super::util;
